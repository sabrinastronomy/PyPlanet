The current data base components are:
 NA2O  MGO   AL2O3 SIO2  CAO   FEO  
Transform them (Y/N)? 
N

Calculations with saturated components (Y/N)?
N

Use chemical potentials, activities or fugacities as independent
variables (Y/N)?

Select thermodynamic components from the set:
 NA2O  MGO   AL2O3 SIO2  CAO   FEO  
Enter names, 1 per line, press <enter> to finish:
Specify computational mode:

     1 - Convex-Hull minimization
     2 - Constrained minimization on a 2d grid [default]
     3 - Constrained minimization on a 1d grid
     4 - Output pseudocompound data
     5 - Phase fractionation calculations

Use Convex-Hull minimization for Schreinemakers projections or phase diagrams
with > 2 independent variables. Use constrained minimization for phase diagrams
or phase diagram sections with < 3 independent variables.

The data base has P(bar)   and T(K)     as default independent potentials.
Make one dependent on the other, e.g., as along a geothermal gradient (y/n)? 

Select x-axis variable:
     1 - P(bar)  
     2 - T(K)    
     3 - Composition X(C1)* (user defined)

*X(C1) can not be selected as the y-axis variable


Enter minimum and maximum values, respectively, for: T(K)    

Enter minimum and maximum values, respectively, for: P(bar)  

For gridded minimization, grid resolution is determined by the number of levels
(grid_levels) and the resolution at the lowest level in the X- and Y-directions (x_nodes
and y_nodes) these parameters are currently set for the exploratory and autorefine cycles
as follows:

stage        grid_levels  xnodes  ynodes    effective resolution
exploratory       1          40      40        40 x  40 nodes
auto-refine       4          60      60       473 x 473 nodes

To change these options edit or create the file /Users/sabrinaberger/PerPlex/perplex_option.dat
